<h3>A react native app with basic firebase auth</h3>

Insert your own google-services.json file from firebase in /android/app folder

To run:
----------------
npm install
npm start

and then:
npm run android

or whatever it is for IOS

** Not tested in IOS **
coz I don't own a MAC :(

Based on react-native-firebase-starter kit
